This stuff isn't intended to compile at the moment, just some placeholder things mainly for me to put ideas down to get an idea of how it will work.
(There's no entry point so no use trying to compile at the moment :D )

BUT, as RakNet will be required in the end when there's some stuff to implement..

1. Download RakNet - http://www.raknet.com/raknet/downloads/RakNet_PC-4.033.zip 

2. Unpack somewhere obvs

3. Add an environment variable for it if you want, but as we're all using our own project files / make things at the moment that doesn't really matter

4. ADDITIONAL INCLUDE DIRECTORIES (for header files) : path/to/RakNet/src

5. ADDITONNAL LIBRARIES (to link against) : ws2_32.lib

It's basically given in the first tutorial at http://www.raknet.net/raknet/manual/tutorial.html
But just add stuff into the project you already have when the time comes.

It also says to change Character Set to 'Not Set' but Ogre asks for something else. Don't know what destruction that will cause. Hide behind something just in case.
