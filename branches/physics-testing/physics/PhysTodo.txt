// Please add as you think of stuff

Steering user input is not framerate independent
events system triggered on collisions and acceleration etc. for sound triggers
damage meter
more complex terrain than a flat plane
CarSnapshot doesn't include accel value

// Stuff not really physics

shadows are messed up
precompiled headers dont work
we need "VIP game mode" as opposed to an aimless drive around
