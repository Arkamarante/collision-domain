Compiling CEGUI from source and integrating to Ogre is pretty retarded and long winded 
so I've just uploaded compiled libs and the headers it needs.

#### INCLUDES ####

Add to include directories: /shared/cegui/include

#### LIBRARIES ####

Add to library directories: /shared/cegui/lib

Add to library includes: 

CEGUIOgreRenderer.lib
CEGUIBase.lib
CEGUIExpatParser.lib
CEGUIFalagardWRBase.lib

Or the _d versions if you're building in debug

#### RESOURCES ####

CEGUI needs to access resources in the same way Ogre does.

Sooo, in your OgreSDK/bin/$(Config) directory (where things get built to, debug and release)

EDIT: resources.cfg

ADD:

[Imagesets]
FileSystem=../../datafiles/imagesets
[Fonts]
FileSystem=../../datafiles/fonts
[Schemes]
FileSystem=../../datafiles/schemes
[LookNFeel]
FileSystem=../../datafiles/looknfeel
[Layouts]
FileSystem=../../datafiles/layouts


Then, copy the /shared/cegui/datafiles folder into your OgreSDK folder (same place as media)

(You can change paths and stuff if you want if you'd rather put the datafiles inside /media/)
