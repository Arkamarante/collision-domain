1. Download RakNet - http://www.raknet.com/raknet/downloads/RakNet_PC-4.033.zip
2. Unpack somewhere
	OR
1. Just use /raknet from the repo

3. Add an environment variable for it if you want, but as we're all using our own project files / make things at the moment that doesn't really matter

4. ADDITIONAL INCLUDE DIRECTORIES (for header files) : path/to/RakNet/source/   (or path to /raknet from the repo)

5. ADDITONNAL LIBRARIES (to link against) : ws2_32.lib

6. If using Visual Studio, stop here :-)


Also need to compile the files in raknet/source/
Can ignore the /cat/ folder it seems

It's basically given in the first tutorial at http://www.raknet.net/raknet/manual/tutorial.html
But just add stuff into the project you already have when the time comes.

It also says to change Character Set to 'Not Set' but Ogre asks for something else. Not Set seems to work fine.
